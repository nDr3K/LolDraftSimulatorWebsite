# League of Legends Draft Simulator (Frontend)

This project is a React-based frontend for simulating League of Legends drafts. It is designed to be used alongside the [LolDraftSimulatorServer](https://github.com/nDr3K/LolDraftSimulatorServer) repository, providing an intuitive interface for drafting champions either solo or with others.

## Features:
- **Single Player Draft**: Allows you to draft alone in a single window.
- **Multiplayer Drafting**: Create a lobby to draft with friends or other players in real-time.
- **Spectator Mode**: Spectators can watch the draft as it happens without participating.
- **Fearless Mode**: Fearless mode is available up to 5 drafts.
- **Ban Style Options**: Choose between **SoloQ** or **Tournament-style** bans.
- **Champion Exclusion**: Prior to starting the draft, you can disable specific champions to avoid selecting them during the draft.

## Live Demo:
